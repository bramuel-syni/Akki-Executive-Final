# AKKI Sandbox — Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Original problem statement
AKKI is a Context-primary intelligence platform for Non-Executive Directors (NEDs) and
operating Executives. The BRD pivoted from v1.0 (Tenant B2B) → v3.0 (Context-primary) →
v4.0 (Build Sequence — 18 modules across 5 streams with prescriptive design mandates).
The user selected **Path A (v4.0 Free Tier)**: follow v4.0 module boundaries but skip any
module that requires a paid/external service.

## User personas
- **Non-Executive Director (NED)** — Serves on one or more boards. Needs cross-board
  pattern awareness, pre-board briefings, and open-thread tracking.
- **Operating Executive** — Prepares for a specific board meeting. Needs pre-board prep,
  team roll-up, org highlights, and post-board follow-up tracking.
- **Dual** — Both roles; switches acting-role from the top nav role switcher.
- **Reportee** — Submits reports to an Executive (minimal scope).

## Core architecture
- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind + Shadcn UI. Brand: navy `#0A1F44`, gold `#C9A961`.
- **Backend**: FastAPI + MongoDB, custom JWT (bcrypt) + optional TOTP MFA.
- **LLM**: Emergent Universal Key → Claude Sonnet 4.5 via emergentintegrations.
  Deterministic mock fallback if key missing.
- **Mocked in-process** (paid equivalents deferred): Synisense trust/shielding layer,
  S3 (local disk at `/app/backend/uploads`), virus scan, vector DB (prompt-inline grounding).

## Surfaces
| # | Surface | v4.0 Module | Status |
|---|---------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Home (role-specific: NED / Executive) | M15/M16 | **Live** |
| 2 | Workspace (60/40 split + persistent Ask) | M18 | **Live** |
| 3 | Highlights (3-column Twitter-style feed) | M17 | **Live** |
| 4 | Ask (top-level) | M13 | **Live** |
| 5 | Document Viewer (`/app/documents/:id`) | M7 | **Live** |
| 6 | Learn | M9 | Locked |
| 7 | Settings | M0 | **Live** |

## Implemented (by date)
### 2026-04-22 — v3.0 Path B MVP
- G1 Scaffold, M0 Contexts/Memberships/Orgs model, M1 shell+switchers+Cmd-K,
  M2 onboarding wizard + Context Object versioning, M3 document upload pipeline
  (PDF/DOCX/TXT), M5 backend signals + ask (grounded, shielded).
- M5 frontend — Highlights + Ask pages wired.
- Brute-force lockout bug fixed (ident keyed on email only, not ip:email).

### 2026-04-23 — v4.2 Frontend Polish (Path B + Act + Learn)
- **Theme swap**: cream `#F7F3EA` + oxblood `#8B2E2B` + Georgia serif leads +
  Inter chrome + JetBrains Mono for metadata. Tokenised as CSS variables plus
  rewired Shadcn HSL tokens. All new utility classes (`akki-lead`, `akki-greeting`,
  `akki-scope-chip`, `akki-context-chip`, `akki-gesture`, `akki-stream-card`).
- **AppShell re-skin**: top cream chrome with AKKI wordmark + context switcher +
  role switcher + global search button (⌘K) + avatar; 220px cream left rail
  with 3px oxblood accent on the selected nav item.
- **Attention stream Home** (replaces NedHome + ExecHome): single role-aware
  card stream ranking signals / briefings / recent documents by freshness, with
  scope chips (All / Signals / Briefings / Documents) and a 280px companion
  rail (Sources / Recent briefings / Quick actions / Other contexts).
- **Highlights** rewritten to the same card pattern with a filter bar
  (type + confidence) and per-card "Act on this" button.
- **StreamCard** shared component: 3-row structure (type badge + timestamp /
  Georgia 18px lead / context chips + oxblood gesture), 3px severity-colored
  left accent that thickens on hover.
- **Ask merged into Workspace** per v4.2 spec: `/app/ask` redirects to
  `/app/workspace`; Ask nav item removed. The persistent AskPanel on the
  Workspace right pane is now the only Ask surface.
- **Act overlay** (`ActModal`): unified 720px composition modal with two
  destinations — *Message someone* (opens user's mail client pre-filled with
  signal headline + summary + citations) and *Add to briefing* (backs to
  `POST /api/contexts/:id/briefings` with the single signal).
- **Learn module (M9)**: seven curated articles on AI governance for boards —
  Governance basics, NIST + ISO 42001 frameworks, AI in financial services,
  AI literacy in 60 minutes, EU AI Act, Incident response, Vendor AI oversight.
  Each article pulls content from reputable sources (NACD, IoD, Deloitte,
  Stanford HAI, NIST, European Commission, FCA/BoE, ICO) and closes with
  "questions to take into the room". Search + topic filter in the library grid.
  Reader view at `/app/learn/:id`.
- **Reusable `AskPanel`** component — used by both `/app/ask` and Workspace right pane.
  Supports `onCitationClick(docId)` so `[doc:xxx]` citations can drive behaviour in the host.
- **`DocumentViewer`** page (`/app/documents/:id`) with extracted-text render +
  outline rail (heading detection heuristic) + back/download controls.
- **Workspace 60/40 split** (M18): left pane shows either the documents browser
  (upload + list) or the selected document viewer; right pane is a persistent AskPanel.
  Draggable divider (clamped 35–75%). Clicking a `[doc:xxx]` citation in the right
  Ask panel loads that document in the left pane.
- **Highlights 3-column feed** (M17): left filter rail (type/trust/confidence),
  central Twitter-style feed with relative timestamps, right rail with at-a-glance
  counts + source documents + Ask CTA. Source chips link to the Document Viewer.
- **`NedHome`** (M15): board grid sorted by meeting proximity, cross-board pulse
  card when ≥2 NED contexts and signals exist, add-a-board affordance. Uses stable
  pseudo-random `daysUntilNextMeeting` as placeholder until M6 Integrations.
- **`ExecHome`** (M16): 4-band layout — Pre-Board Prep, Team Reporting, Org
  Highlights, Post-Board Follow-up — with cadence-driven ordering (approaching /
  mid-cycle / post-meeting).
- **`AppHome`**: onboarding gate hero when audit incomplete; otherwise routes to
  NedHome or ExecHome based on `activeRole`.
- Nested `<button>` hydration warning fixed in Workspace doc row (div[role=button]
  with `stopPropagation` on the trust selector).

## Test credentials
See `/app/memory/test_credentials.md`. Admin: `admin@akki.ai` / `AkkiAdmin2026!`.

## Backend regression suite
`/app/backend/tests/test_akki_v3.py` — 55 pytest cases (M0–M5). Iteration 2 smoke
tests (15/15) confirm auth + documents + signals + ask pipeline stable after frontend
restructure.

## Prioritized backlog

### P0 — SHIPPED (2026-04-23 → 2026-04-24)
- [x] **M12 Briefings** — auto-composed via `routers/briefings.py` (PDF+DOCX export).
- [x] **M14 Lens Room** — `routers/lens.py` + `pages/LensRoom.jsx` — 6 frameworks,
      O→I→A output.
- [x] **M11 Event-driven signals pipeline** — `routers/pipeline.py` — 4 staged events
      (candidate_drafted → verified → persisted) with full auditability via
      `signal_events` collection.
- [x] **M13 Hybrid retrieval for Ask** — BM25 across chunks (`bm25.py`).
- [x] **M5 Upload channels** — secure links + mobile camera capture.
- [x] **Finish server.py refactor** — DONE (2026-04-24). server.py is now a
      171-line thin assembler; auth/contexts/documents/misc all in their own
      routers. 4 new router modules, core.py expanded with shared helpers.
- [x] **Real Synisense PII shielding** — regex-based masking in `llm_service.py`,
      full `shielding.{identifiers_masked, by_category, shielded_by}` dict now
      surfaced on every LLM-backed endpoint response.

### P0 — remaining
- _(none — all P0 items complete)_

### P1 — Polish
- [ ] Onboarding wizard end-to-end frontend subagent coverage.
- [ ] Minor: POST `/api/auth/refresh` should return `access_token` in body for
      bearer-only clients.
- [ ] Minor: Add top-level `token` field to invitation creation response.

### P2 — Paid / external integrations (explicitly deferred)
- [ ] **M4 Stripe Billing** — sponsored seat subscriptions (test key available in pod).
- [ ] **Real vector DB** — Pinecone or pgvector (current BM25 is sufficient for MVP).
- [ ] **M6 Integrations** — Google Calendar, board portals (Diligent / BoardPaQ).
- [ ] **Clerk / Auth0** — v4.0 M1 preference; we use custom JWT (recommended to keep).
- [ ] **Unstructured.io** — richer extraction than our `pypdf` + `python-docx`.
- [ ] **ClamAV / VirusTotal** — real virus scan (we use a stub).

## Recent fixes
## Recent fixes
## Recent fixes
- **2026-04-24 Sprint 8** — Speaking notes on the board deck.
  - New endpoint `POST /api/contexts/{cid}/briefings/{bid}/speaking-notes`
    — one LLM call produces 3 spoken-voice bullets per briefing item (fact →
    why it matters → what to watch/escalate). Persisted to
    `briefing.items[i].speaking_notes` + timestamp on
    `briefing.speaking_notes_at`.
  - `render_board_deck_pdf` now renders them under each item slide, prefaced
    by a tiny `WHAT YOU WOULD SAY` label in oxblood + Georgia-italic bullets
    in muted slate. Only appears when drafted.
  - Briefings page gets a new outlined oxblood "Draft speaking notes" button
    that toggles to "Re-draft notes" once notes exist, and a small "+ notes"
    chip lands on the Board deck pill after drafting.
  - iteration_11: 8/8 backend tests PASS (happy path, idempotency, 404, 401,
    400 empty-items, PDF embedding, /ask shielding regression, deck-without-
    notes regression). Frontend 100%, zero console errors.

- **2026-04-24 Sprint 7** — Executive-ready board deck + housekeeping + visual life.
  - **Board deck PDF** (new `render_board_deck_pdf` in `briefings_service.py`):
    landscape A4, one signal per slide — cover, executive summary, per-item
    slides (headline + evidence + sharpest question + source chips), optional
    closing slide, final "Receipts" sources slide. Oxblood/Cream palette +
    serif/sans split. Exposed as `GET /export?fmt=board_deck`. Briefings page
    gets a new oxblood "Board deck" pill left of PDF/DOCX.
  - **Housekeeping sidebar** — two new nav items below Learn: "Manage my team"
    and "Manage my companies", both deep-linking to `/app/manage?tab=…`.
    Sidebar items now slide in with a staggered framer-motion entrance.
  - **`/app/manage` page** (new `Manage.jsx`) — 2-tab surface:
      · **Team** — invite / revoke invitation / remove member scoped to the
        active context. Admin-only write actions. Link out to full settings.
      · **Companies** — grid of all user contexts with hover-lift motion,
        quick "Switch & open" action, non-destructive "Archive" confirm,
        and a top-right "Add company" pill.
  - **Motion pass** — framer-motion installed. AppHome top-signals + Highlights
    signals grid + Manage members/companies now enter with stagger animation;
    Manage tab indicator uses `layoutId` for spring-animated underline.
  - **Highlights stats strip** (`HighlightsStats.jsx`) — pure-SVG confidence
    donut + 14-day sparkline in oxblood tones. Sits above the committee
    filter so the reader sees shape → scope → cards. Zero chart-lib
    dependency.
  - **Testing** — iteration_10: 5/5 new backend tests PASS, frontend 100% on
    all new surfaces, zero console errors.

- **2026-04-24 Sprint 6** — Shielding payload regression fixed + server.py refactor completed.
  - **Shielding fix**: every LLM-backed endpoint now returns a top-level
    `shielding: {identifiers_masked, by_category, shielded_by}` dict alongside
    the legacy scalar count. Touched: `/signals/generate`, `/ask`,
    `/briefings`, `/simulate`, `/lens/run`, `/documents/generate-meta`.
    iter8 flagged → iter9 100% green.
  - **server.py refactor**: 1,400 → 171 lines (88% reduction). Extracted into
    4 new routers: `routers/auth.py` (register/login/logout/refresh/me/role/MFA),
    `routers/contexts.py` (CRUD + members + invitations + context-object +
    presets + accounts/me), `routers/documents.py` (upload + thread +
    list/get/patch/archive/download + generate-meta), `routers/misc.py`
    (llm/probe + /events + /health). `core.py` now exports
    `hash_password` / `verify_password` / `set_auth_cookies` /
    `sanitize_account` / `sanitize_context` / `provision_default_context`.
    server.py is now a pure assembler (startup indexes + admin seed + router
    wiring + CORS). iteration_9: 100% backend — 52 existing sprint tests +
    11 new iter9 refactor-smoke tests all green.

- **2026-04-24 Sprint 5** — Shipped: AllLensesModal (fires 6 lenses in
  parallel from any signal card), mobile camera upload in Workspace
  (`capture="environment"`), lightweight CompositionStrip provenance panel
  on Briefings/Simulate/LensRoom, audit-log + export extracted to
  `routers/audit.py` (server.py now 1,253 lines, 35% off original).
  iteration_7: 100% backend (10/10), 95% frontend (2 cosmetic nits fixed:
  DialogDescription a11y + clickable simulate-list testid — already present).

- **2026-04-24 Sprint 4** — Shipped: landing-page executive rewrite, M13
  BM25 Ask retrieval (`bm25.py`), Pipeline trace drawer on Highlights,
  "Boards to watch this week" Portfolio banner, continued server.py
  refactor (signals+ask extracted; now 33% off original). iteration_6:
  100% backend (7/7), 100% frontend, zero issues.

- **2026-04-23 Sprint 3** — Shipped: role auto-route (AuthContext), Mention
  Inbox bell in AppShell header, CommitteeManager in Settings, signals+ask
  router extraction, M14 Lens Room (6 frameworks, full page), M11 event-
  driven pipeline (4 stages, signal_events trace). iteration_5: 100% backend
  (10/10), 100% frontend.

- **2026-04-23** — **Sprint 1 shipped** (3 of the user's 7-point feedback list).
  - **Task 1 — Curated Home** (Feedback #2): `AppHome.jsx` now shows top-of-pile
    content as **three sibling tabs** — *Top signals* (≤3, ranked by confidence
    then risk-bias then recency), *Top briefings* (≤2 by recency), *New
    documents* (≤3 by recency) — with a single right-aligned "View all" link
    that follows the active tab (`/app/highlights`, `/app/briefings`,
    `/app/workspace`). Default tab is *Top signals*. Fixed page height
    (`h-[calc(100vh-4rem)]`) — only the active panel scrolls; chrome stays put.
    Companion rail adds "My portfolio" link to `/app/contexts`.
  - **Task 2 — Learn mini-tabs** (Feedback #1): `Learn.jsx` refactored to four
    content-type tabs (`News · TL Articles · Videos · Case Studies`) with
    underline accent on active tab, per-tab topic pills on the left rail, and
    fixed page height — only the card grid scrolls (`data-testid=learn-scroll`).
    Added `content_type` field to each article in `lib/learnContent.js`, new
    `LEARN_NEWS` array with 3 curated briefs (EU GPAI Code, FCA supervisory
    posture, NACD 2026 benchmark), and `CONTENT_TYPE_LABEL` map.
  - **Task 3 — Context Portfolio page** (Feedback #5): NEW `/app/contexts`
    surface (`ContextPortfolio.jsx`). Portfolio summary strip shows totals for
    Contexts / Signals / Briefings / Documents. Cards grouped into
    *NED boards* and *Executive contexts*; each card shows type/admin chip,
    sponsored badge, per-context metrics (signals/briefings/documents fetched
    in parallel). Clicking a card calls `switchContext` and navigates to `/app`.
    `AppShell` context dropdown now has a "View portfolio" item at the top
    (`data-testid=context-portfolio-btn`).
  - **Testing**: iteration_3 — 100% backend, 100% frontend. No critical or
    minor issues. Two design notes flagged (summary-strip "…" during fan-out;
    role-mismatch banner ever-present because Bramuel's default context is NED
    while `activeRole` defaults to `executive`) — both working-as-designed.

## Sprint 2 — SHIPPED 2026-04-23 (items 3 / 6 / 7 complete)
### Phase 1 — Backend refactor
- **NEW** `/app/backend/core.py`: single source for db + helpers + auth deps.
- **NEW** `/app/backend/routers/{briefings,learn,committees,simulate,comments}.py`.
- `server.py`: 1,941 → 1,570 lines. Pattern proven for future router migrations.

### Phase 2 — Sub-committees (Feedback #6)
- Contexts carry `committees: [{id, name, your_role}]`; IDs auto-backfilled on
  startup for seeded boards.
- Full CRUD at `/api/contexts/{id}/committees` (owner-only writes); deletion
  unsets `committee_id` on referencing artefacts.
- `committee_id` filter query param added to signals, briefings, documents,
  simulations list endpoints.
- Highlights shows a "Scope" chip row; Briefings left-rail gets a committee
  `<select>`. Chair badge rendered when `your_role === "chair"`.

### Phase 3 — Simulate / Forecasting (Feedback #3)
- New surface `/app/simulate`. LLM produces Best / Base / Stress paragraphs
  for 1y and/or 3y horizon, a 3–6 item watchlist with early-warning triggers
  and committee routing, assumptions, and the single sharpest board question.
- Backend: `routers/simulate.py`. Side-nav adds **Simulate** (Target icon).

### Phase 4 — Human-to-human collaboration (Feedback #7)
- Polymorphic comment store — artefacts: signal / briefing / document / simulation.
  Threaded via flat list + `parent_id` for single-level replies.
- `@mentions` parsed from body, resolved to context members by email-prefix
  or first-name. Mention records written to a separate collection (inbox-ready).
- Endpoints: `GET/POST /api/contexts/{id}/{artefact_type}/{id}/comments`,
  `DELETE /api/contexts/{id}/comments/{id}`, `GET /mentions`, mark-read.
- **NEW** `CommentThread.jsx` wired into Briefings, Simulate, DocumentViewer
  viewers. Includes @mention highlight, relative timestamps, delete (author
  or context admin), ping-count badge.

### Testing
- iteration_4 — 100% backend (18/18), 100% frontend on all Sprint-2 testids.
- Only non-blocking note: pre-existing role-mismatch banner (unchanged since
  iteration 3).

## Recent fixes
- **2026-04-23** — Workspace doc row nested-button hydration warning: outer wrapper
  converted to `<div role="button" tabIndex={0}>` with keyboard handler; TrustChip
  wrapped in a `stopPropagation` span so changing trust doesn't open the document.
- **2026-04-22** — Brute-force login lockout: was keyed on `ip:email`; changed to
  email-only because Kubernetes ingress rotates `request.client.host`. Verified
  5×401 → 429 on 6th attempt.
